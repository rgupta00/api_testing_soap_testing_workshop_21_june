API Testing with soap and rest workshop:
-------------------------------------------

What is API?
• API stands for Application Programming Interface
• APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other 
    using a set of definitions and protocols.
• API contains collections of functions and procedures

Types
• Private AΡΙ
• Public API
• Partner API
• Composite API

What are Web Services?
•A Web service is a software package that is used for communicating between 
two devices or web entities lying on the network.
Types:-
• SOAP Web Services
• REST Web Services

• The abbreviation of SOAP is the Simple Object Access Protocol.
   All its messages are usually in XML format, The SOAP message consists of: Root element, Headers & body
   
   
• REST stands for Representational State Transfer,
 It establishes connection over http or https protocol
 (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.). 
 The allocation of resources in REST depends on the URL & it's
 messages will be in JSON, Text, HTML, XML etc.
 
 
 
how to test soap web service?
-------------------------------
demo how to write the code (Java dev , show some spring boot is a framework to rest rest api)

What is SOAP

2 ways to write web services:
1. REST web services
2. SOAP web services
Simple Object Access protocol

SOAP web service testing:
======================================

	 contains
	 not contains
 
	
Agenda lession 2:
------------------
Testing simple calculator application
Creating soap project using WSDL
create test suite and test cases
added contains assertions
execute test in sequence and parallel
documentation

Agenda lession 3:
------------------
Contains
Not contains
Xpath Query match
Invalid http status code
valid http status code
soap faults

Example:
https://ws.footballpool.dataaccess.eu/info.wso?WSDL

We should have understanding of some fundaments:
-------------------------------------------------
xml: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/

XML schema: used to validation xml doc
	https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp
	
XML DTD (older way to validation xml)
	https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd.asp
	
Xpath:
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp
Xpath: is a query language for selecting 
nodes form xml documents

XPath can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.
	XPath stands for XML Path Language
	XPath uses "path like" syntax to identify and navigate nodes in an XML document
	XPath contains over 200 built-in functions
	XPath is a major element in the XSLT standard
	XPath is a W3C recommendation
	


http://xpather.com/

All player:

Example: we can to assert that id of first player is 6100

//m:AllPlayerNamesResponse/m:AllPlayerNamesResult/m:tPlayerName[1]/m:iId


Example: we can to assert that name of first player is "Constantin Grameni"

//m:AllPlayerNamesResponse/m:AllPlayerNamesResult/m:tPlayerName[1]/m:sName

Example: we can to assert how many sname tag presents?

//count(//m:sName)

Tag presence:
//m:AllPlayerNamesResponse/m:AllPlayerNamesResult/m:tPlayerName/m:sName
true

Check sName match:
matches(//m:AllPlayerNamesResponse/m:AllPlayerNamesResult/m:tPlayerName[1]/m:sName,"Aaron Cresswell")
true

Check Names should have only alphabets:
matches(//m:AllPlayerNamesResponse/m:AllPlayerNamesResult/m:tPlayerName[1]/m:sName,'[A-Za-z]*')
true

Check ID's should have only digits:
matches(//m:AllPlayerNamesResponse/m:AllPlayerNamesResult/m:tPlayerName[1]/m:iId,'\d')
true



XQuery:
it is language for Querying XML data
XQuery is to XML same as SQL to database
XQuery buid on top of Xpath expression
XQuery use functions to extract data from xml documents

Tutorial :
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xquery_intro.asp

Example:
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/books.xml


Invalid/Valid http status code:
---------------------------
understanding http status code




















http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?wsdl
install Wizdler - Chrome Web Store as plugin

Q: how to create doc for soap web service
	wsdl file act as documentation: no need to have extra doc
	knowledge to read wsdl correctly
	
		 
		 
		rest: swagger to create doc

 
 
 
 Post is non idemoptent
 Http Status code
 
 REST build on top of http protocol
 
 Uniform interface:
	 A group of methods, such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE, 
	that are easily understood by the client and server
Stateless: Each request is processed independently from the previous ones

Cacheable: REST is cache friendly and supports multiple formats

Client-server: 
	The server has "resources" that are presented to the client as a representation of the resource's state

Layered system: 
	Individual components cannot see beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting 


Topic - 01 (API Testing)
-------------------------
What is Postman?
	tool to test rest api
	free to insall and use in production system
	download and just install
	login with ur username/password : gmail
	
• What is API & its types?
	web api: REST api
	
• What are Web Services? & It's types
	REST 
	SOAP
	
• How to Install Postman?
	:)
• What are the other software's required?
	nodejs, npm package manager
	
• Create Collections & Folders
• How to Create First Request in Postman?
• Create GET, POST, PUT & DELETE Requests

https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Booking-CreateBooking


Topic - 02 (API Testing)
-------------------------
Negative Scenarios
• How to declare & use Environment Variables?
• How to save response in variable?
• Postman Console - Debugging
• Create automatic API tests?
• Assertions -
• Status code
• Response body contains
• Response header
• Response time

• use Environment Variables?
Environment
	dev test pre prod prod
	
Negative Scenarios
	• Record not found
	• Request has invalid characters
	• Values has to many characters
	• Request sent with missing information
	• Value is not in correct format
	

Ex: How to declare & use Environment Variables?
let we want to use firstname for env variable
let we want to use lastname for env variable

Ex: we will create a new booking 
 "bookingid": 392
 now we want to define bookingid into a variable so that it can be used in all the 
 crud methods
 
var jsonData=pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("b_id",jsonData.bookingid);
it will set a variable once we run the request

https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking/{{b_id}}

Do same for api token used to update the api



Topic - 03 (API Testing)
-------------------------
Advanced Assertions
• JSON Assertion
• Nested JSON Assertion
• Curl Command
• How to execute Collection?
• How to execute folder?
• Exclude tests script from execution
• How to Export Collection?

security

	basics auth: here username and password need to be passed with each request
	jwt token: here rather then username and password we will pass the jwt token
	oauth: mainly use for authorization using 3rd party application
	
	login using facebook
	......
	
Testing JWT based api:
======================

https://survayapi.themetasum.com/swagger/index.html

url for resitering new user:
https://survayapi.themetasum.com/api/Authenticate/Register

url for getting jwt token, u need to login the the app with the username/password you have registered:
https://survayapi.themetasum.com/api/Authenticate/login



calling a secure api:
	1. without token : 401
	2. with valid token : 200 with data

How to develop rest api?
----------------------
rest : python
rest : c#
rest : java
rest : js

Spring boot is a defacto stand to create microservice rest api application

it provide you a template to create rest api

Not soap faults
SOAP response 
Response SLA
script assertions
Json path count
Json path match
